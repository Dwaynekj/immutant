* Introduction

  The JBoss Application Server (AS7) is the foundation upon which Immutant
  is built. You can go a long way with Immutant without knowing anything
  about the administration of JBoss AS, but for advanced applications, it's
  worth knowing something about how AS is configured and extended. Feel free
  to skip this section if you're just getting started with Immutant, and use 
  it as a reference later.

  For more detailed documentation, please read the [[https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Documentation][official AS7 docs]].

* Configuring

  In AS7, all server configuration is kept in two folders, one for each runtime 
  mode: *standalone* and *domain*. Administrative tasks are simplified from 
  previous releases because all configuration is in one folder and, in 
  standalone mode, in a single file.

  Immutant uses standalone mode by default but can be run in domain mode as 
  well.
  
  JBoss AS 7 uses a modular architecture - libraries common to all server 
  configurations are kept under the =modules/= directory. Configuration files
  are stored inside =standalone/configuration/= and =domain/configuration/= 
  folders.

  Both standalone and domain modes have a common folder structure, including
  the following directories: =configuration/=, =deployments/=, and =lib/=. 
  In general, it isn't a good idea to remove anything from these directories 
  that you didn't put there yourself.

  [[./images/jboss-standalone-mode.png]]

  Some additional directories are created automatically at runtime, as needed: 
  =tmp/=, =data/=, and =log/=. Though not typically necessary, you may safely 
  delete these when the server is not running to clear its persistent state.

* Running

  The =$JBOSS_HOME/bin/= directory contains the main JBoss entry point, 
  =standalone.sh= (or =standalone.bat=), along with its config file, 
  =standalone.conf=. Running the JBoss server is simple:

  #+begin_src sh
   $ $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh 
  #+end_src

  Use the =--server-config= option to specify a different configuration. For 
  example, to put JBoss in "clustered" mode:

  #+begin_src sh
   $ $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh --server-config=standalone-ha.xml
  #+end_src

  You may set Java system properties using the =-D= option. Pass =-h= for a 
  list of all the available options.

  Permanent runtime configuration of JBoss should go in =bin/standalone.conf=.
  For example, your application may require more memory (RAM) than the default
  allocated. Edit =standalone.conf= to increase the value of =-Xmx= to something
  reasonable.

  In production you may prefer to control JBoss via a Unix "init script", examples
  of which may be found in =bin/=. Feel free to tweak one for your particular OS.

* Deploying

  Each runtime mode has a =deployments/= subdirectory, the contents of which 
  determine the applications and services JBoss runs. These apps and services
  are represented as archives, "exploded" folders, or text files called 
  "deployment descriptors". The JBoss deployment scanner operates  in two different
  modes: *auto-deploy* and *manual deploy*.

  Auto-deploy mode works like in previous releases of AS, in that a resource will
  be redeployed every time the its timestamp  changes. The scanner creates a marker 
  file with a ".deployed" suffix, and if the resource gets deleted the scanner will 
  not trigger an undeployment.

  In manual deploy mode the scanner will rely on addition or removal of a marker 
  files. To more about this deployment method, see the marker files section of
  the [[https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Admin%2BGuide#AdminGuide-DeploymentCommands][administrator guide]].

  [[./images/jboss-deploy.png]]

  The [[https://github.com/immutant/lein-immutant][lein-immutant Leiningen plugin]] provides commands to create and copy a 
  deployment descriptor for your Clojure application to 
  =$IMMUTANT_HOME/standalone/deployments/=. 

* Logging

  Each runtime mode has a =log/= subdirectory (created at runtime, if necessary) 
  that contains the log messages generated by JBoss as determined by its configuration.

  JBoss provides a very sophisticated logging system that nobody completely understands. 
  Logging configuration rules are contained in =standalone/configuration/logging.properties=, 
  in which may be found example configs for categorized log message routing, complex file
  rotation, syslog integration, SMTP notifications, SNMP traps, JMS, JMX and more! It is WAY
  beyond the scope of this document to explain those rules, but by default you will see INFO 
  messages on the console (the shell where you start JBoss) and persistently written to 
  =log/server.log=.

  Any messages written to =*out*= or =*err*= will also be displayed on the console and 
  written to =log/server.log=.
