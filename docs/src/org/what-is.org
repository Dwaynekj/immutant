* Introduction

  Immutant is essentially an enhanced version of the [[http://jboss.org/jbossas][JBoss enterprise
  application server]]. It repackages AS7 with additional modules
  supporting Clojure applications, similar to what its sister
  [[http://torquebox.org][TorqueBox]] project does for Ruby apps.
  
  Immutant reduces the *incidental complexity* (originally [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet][accidental]])
  inherent in non-trivial applications by providing integrated
  solutions for web, messaging, scheduling, caching, clustering, and
  more. This frees the developer from having to build a unique stack
  from scratch, not to mention the responsibility of supporting the
  evolution of that stack as the application requirements expand.
