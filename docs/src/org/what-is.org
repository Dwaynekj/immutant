* Introduction

  Immutant is essentially an enhanced version of the [[http://jboss.org/jbossas][JBoss Application Server 7]]. 
  It repackages AS7 with additional modules that support Clojure applications, 
  similar to what the [[http://torquebox.org][TorqueBox]] project does for Ruby applications.
  
  Immutant reduces the *incidental complexity* 
  inherent in non-trivial applications by providing integrated
  solutions for web, messaging, scheduling, caching, clustering, and
  more. This frees the developer from having to build a unique stack
  from scratch, not to mention the responsibility of supporting the
  evolution of that stack as the application requirements expand.
